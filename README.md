# hello-world

Greetings, fellow humans!

My name is Aaron Yee. I'm a sophomore at the University of Arizona studying Computer Science.
My hobbies include, learning to code, writing code, and failing to make said code work.
So cheers, mates. May your bugs be trivial and your code somewhat functional.
Best wishes.
